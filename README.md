# UWPRP

Welcome to Untitled Worker Placement Roguelite Project!

In UWPRP, you play as the leader of a small village on a raft floating down a river or something (I don't have the flavor 100% nailed down, but we'll get there). You command your subjects to do various tasks that will protect the village from the monsters that you encounter along the river for whatever reason.

UWPRP is (or will be, eventually) a roguelite game with worker-placement mechanics inspired by games like Slay the Spire, Agricola, and Age of Empires.

See `help.txt` for a slightly more in-depth tutorial.

# How to Run

Run `ruby main.rb` from the command line in the game directory.
