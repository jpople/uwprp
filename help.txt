How to Play

In UWPRP, you run a village, which consists of a few villagers and tasks that they can be assigned to.  Each turn during a combat encounter (there'll be noncombat encounters Eventually (TM)), you will assign each of your villagers to a task.  Each task can only be worked by one villager per turn.  

After all of your villagers have been assigned, the enemy will take its own turn with its own action.

This process repeats until one of you has your HP reduced to 0 and dies.  Ideally, that would be the enemy.

The tasks are:

* Attack - allows you to deal damage to an enemy
* Block - generates Fortification.  Fortification will negate incoming damage, but expires after the enemy's turn is over.
* Forage - gives you Food.  At the end of each combat, your villagers who have worked hard for you all day are starving and will want 5 food each.  Each villager to whom you can't provide this food will be displeased by your tyranny and deal 20 damage to you.
* Gather - gives you Materials.  These don't do anything yet, don't worry about it.
