How to Play

In UWPRP, you run a village, which consists of a few villagers and tasks that they can be assigned to.  Each turn during a combat encounter (there'll be noncombat encounters Eventually (TM)), you will assign each of your villagers to a task.  Each task can only be worked by one villager per turn.  

After all of your villagers have been assigned, the enemy will take its own turn with its own action.

This process repeats until one of you has your HP reduced to 0 and dies.  Ideally, that would be the enemy.

The player actions are:

PHASE I:
* Attack - Deal damage to an enemy.
* Block - Generate Fortification.  Fortification will negate incoming damage, but expires at the start of each player turn.
* Forage - Gain Food.  At the end of each combat, your villagers who have worked hard for you all day are starving and will want 5 food each.  Each villager to whom you can't provide this food will be displeased by your tyranny and deal 10 damage to you.
* Gather - Gain Materials, which you can spend to Research or Build.
* Research - Pay 10 Materials to permanently unlock new action spaces.

PHASE II (available after you have Researched):
* Build - Pay 10 materials to build a house that can hold another worker.  You can have up to 5 houses.
* Train - Get an additional worker (if you have room).
* Scout - Deal low damage to an enemy and gain low Fortification.
