WORKER PLACEMENTS:

    MUST HAVE:

        - workers that the player assigns individually to actions
        - player can gain more workers
        - once taken, an action (and the worker assigned to it) are unavailable for some amount of time
        - at certain points, pay upkeep cost that scales with number of workers you have
        - management of multiple kinds of resources
        
    CAN HAVE:

        - some actions locked behind time/game progression
        - player can choose not to pay worker upkeep, albeit at a heavy penalty
        - mechanisms to reward player for taking varied actions and not overspecializing, e.g.:
            - actions get better the longer you go without taking them
            - player incurs penalties if they neglect a mechanic/aspect of the game entirely
        - possible action types:
            - gain resource
            - gain worker
            - set up/enhance future actions (e.g. sow fields)
            - "research"; do/get things to improve engine in the short- or long-term
            - convert one type of resource to another
        - possible resource types:
            - “food”; pay worker upkeeps
            - building resources (usually in multiple types) used for research or expansion
            - “victory points”; resource that doesn’t directly improve player’s build or game but offers some other reward instead
        - mechanisms for “returning” player’s workers, e.g.:
            - call some or all assigned workers home as an action
            - play until all workers have been assigned, then they return automatically
            - actions take workers a given amount of time to complete, after which they return automatically

    IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

        - both short-term and long-term deadlines
        - time/opportunity is most meaningful cost to taking actions; that "man, if I just had one more turn" feeling
