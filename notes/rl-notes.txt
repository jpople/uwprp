ROGUELI(K/T)ES:

    MUST HAVE:

        - partially random progression
        - short-term "run"/session
        - runs consist of various kinds of encounters
        - long-term resource management that persists between encounters within a run
        - rewards for taking on combats or equivalents
        - you win or you die

    CAN HAVE:

        - "meta" progression (persists between runs)
        - different starter builds
        - discrete "acts"/areas with different encounter pools/difficulty levels, each ending in a boss
            - is this a can or a must?
        - possible encounter types:
            - combat
                - hallway fights
                - minibosses (sometimes-optional hard fights for extra rewards)
                - bosses (mandatory, at relatively fixed positions)
            - shops
            - rest/healing sites
            - "friendly"/"misc" encounters
        - long-term resource types:
            - possible actions for during encounters (e.g. weapons, cards, active abilities/spells)
            - passive bonuses, or modifiers to actions during encounters
            - currency (implies the existence of shops)
            - HP
        - status effects
            - DOT
            - flat damage buffs/debuffs
        - game state has some notion of "resetting" between encounters (e.g. buffs/debuffs wear off)
        - player is given limited choice in how to proceed (e.g. what type of encounter, or what type of reward)
        - difficulty scaling (this is basically a must for replayability)

    IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

        - risk vs. reward; allow "greedy" plays
        - limited foresight; experienced players should be able to know what can happen, but not necessarily what will
