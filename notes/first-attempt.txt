ACTUAL MECHANICS:

- are all actions available at one time?
    - if yes:
        - how do we maintain variance?
    - if no:
        - how do we pick?
        - how often do new actions show up/old actions go away?
- what do enemies do on their turn?
    - attack player
    - debuff player
    - debuff workers?  what does this look like?
    - make player action worse or unavailable entirely for a period
    - take resources
- how often do enemies take their turn relative to the player?
- how many workers does the player start with?
    - 2 seems nice
- what recall mechanism do we use?
    - とりあえず: agricola-style
- what do rewards look like?
    - add workers (on miniboss)?
    - add new actions to pool: are we just another deckbuilder at that point?
    - upgrade existing actions
    - passive bonuses a la Occupations
    - gain money
    - unlock next phase of actions? maybe every N encounters?

FIRST TIER ACTIONS:
    - bad attack (hit enemy's face for N)
    - bad defend (gain N fortifications)
    - bad gather resources (gain N building resources)
        - maybe: random returns?
        - resources: wood, gold
    - bad infrastructure
        - build house
        - gain food over time
        - convert building resources to food
        - convert HP or gold to food?
    - very bad gain food
    - research: spend building resources to unlock second tier actions 

SECOND TIER ACTIONS:
    - less bad attack (hit enemy's face for N); is this a new action or an in-place upgrade?
    - less bad block (gain N fortifications); see above
    - less bad gather resources
    - infrastructure upgrade; gather gold?
    - "family growth"

COMBAT:
    - at start of combat and when new tier is unlocked, physical placement of actions is randomized; this can matter
    - player places all workers, then enemy takes turn; repeat
    - at end of combat, player loses... 20 HP for each worker unless they pay... 5 food each? sure, let's roll with that
