APPROACH I: ONE AGRICOLA

- engine is never reset over the course of entire run
- not that many encounters; encounters relatively long/intense, maybe something like multiple waves; each ends with a Harvest equivalent
- boss fight follows 

APPROACH II: MULTIPLE AGRICOLAS <--- this is what we're rolling with for now

- engine resets for each "act"
- combats fairly short
- let's say 3 acts, each 10 rooms + boss
- player gets multiple turns to prepare for every enemy turn probably?
- upkeep is paid after every encounter

APPROACH III: OH GOD SO MANY AGRICOLAS

- engine resets entirely for each combat
- enemy takes one turn for each player turn, enemy turns probably have to be pretty low-impact most of the time/attacks few and far between so player doesn't have to block literally all the time
